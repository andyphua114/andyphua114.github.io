      <description>This is my portfolio post. It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using &amp;lsquo;Content here, content here&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>This is it. Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry&amp;rsquo;s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.</description>

      <description>With the rising popularity of earning a degree online, more education institutions are increasingly offering fully online programs. Naturally, different programs vary in terms of costs, quality, curriculum, and course design etc. In the area of data analytics/data science, Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) offers two programs â€” the Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) and Online Master of Science in Analytics (OMSA). As I am more focused on analytics, I have chosen to enroll myself in OMSA.</description>
